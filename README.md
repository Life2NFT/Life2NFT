- 👋 Hi, We are @Life2NFT
- 👀 We are interested in your story and recording everyones story on the blockchain to create a record of our times.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to properly integrate IPFS and DNS so that we can house the audio recordings in a decentralized fashion and offer NFTs to reference these files.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on story telling and all things related to story telling.
- 📫 How to reach me; life2nft@gmail.com
